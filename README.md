# Bitcoin Convertor

An App I Made While Learning About Flutter.

## Hosting

For the time being this app is not hosted on app store or play store, its only available through this repo.


## Brief About This App

It is a very simple flutter app with a very simple UI.


This app uses [Coin API](https://www.coinapi.io/) for Converting the Bitcoin Value for Different Currencies.

It has a bit different UI for distinct Platforms styled according the OS of the system.


## How to Use This App

Clone this Repository or Fork it & make it available on your device.
***
* If you're using Android Studio:

1. Go to pubspec.yaml file & hit pub get.

***

* If you're using VS Code:

1. Run ``` flutter pub get ``` in the root directory.

***

2. This command will fetch the required dependencies & download it to your device.
3. Connect your device with a USB or use an Emulator/Simulator.
4. Then Run ``` main.dart ```

Once the app is built you can disconnect the USB & use it in your mobile phone.

## Coding Part

All the coding was done in flutter which uses dart programming language.

Comments are added wherever necessary so that the code can be easily understood.
